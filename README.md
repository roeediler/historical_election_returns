# 🗳️ Historical Election Returns (1824-1968)  

This project analyzes **county-level election returns** in the United States from **1824 to 1968**, using data from the **Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR 1)**. The dataset provides election results for **presidential, gubernatorial, senatorial, and congressional races**, including votes for over **1,000 political parties and independent candidates**.  

## 📌 Project Goals  
- **Clean and structure** the raw ASCII data using SAS setup files

- **Merge and analyze** historical election trends across different time periods  
- **Create reproducible workflows** for processing ICPSR datasets in R
