# 🗳️ Historical Election Returns (1824-1968)  

This project analyzes **county-level election returns** in the United States from **1824 to 1968**, using data from the **Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR 1)**. The dataset provides election results for **presidential, gubernatorial, senatorial, and congressional races**, including votes for over **1,000 political parties and independent candidates**.  

## 🏛️ Project Background  
This project processes **historical election returns** from the **ICPSR dataset**, handling **ASCII-formatted data**, cleaning it, and generating structured **CSV files** for further analysis.  

The work was part of an **economic history project** I collaborated on with a professor at the **Hebrew University of Jerusalem**. The goal was to **analyze historical election data** to uncover **voting patterns** and **political trends** in the United States. By structuring this data properly, we aimed to facilitate deeper **quantitative research** into historical electoral behavior.

## 📌 Project Goals  
- **Clean and structure** the raw ASCII data using SAS setup files  
- **Correct data errors** (e.g., missing congressional district names, mislabeled variables)  
- **Merge and analyze** historical election trends across different time periods  
- **Create reproducible workflows** for processing ICPSR datasets in R  

## 📊 Data Source  
This project uses data from:  
**Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR 1)**  
[United States Historical Election Returns, 1824-1968](https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR00001.v3)  

## 📂 Data Availability  
The processed dataset is available **upon request** or can be accessed on my **Kaggle profile**:  
📌 **[Kaggle: roeediler](https://www.kaggle.com/roeediler)**  

Due to ICPSR's terms of use, the raw dataset may require **researcher approval**. However, the cleaned and structured data, along with the processing scripts, are provided for **replication and further analysis**. If you need access or have any questions, feel free to **reach out**!

## 🚀 Key Features  

This project demonstrates advanced **data processing, cleaning, and transformation** techniques on **historical election returns**. It showcases the ability to handle **large-scale datasets** using **efficient workflows** in R. Key features include:  

- 📂 **Parsing Complex Data Structures** – Reads raw **ASCII** election data using **SAS setup files**, ensuring accurate variable mapping.  
- 🏛 **Historical Election Data Processing** – Cleans and standardizes **county-level** returns for presidential, gubernatorial, Senate, and House elections from **1824 to 1968**.  
- 🛠 **Data Wrangling & Preprocessing** – Handles **missing values, inconsistencies, and errors** in historical datasets using structured transformations.  
- 📊 **Structured Data Export** – Converts unstructured raw data into **well-formatted CSV files** for **further analysis and visualization**.  
- ⚡ **Efficient & Scalable Processing** – Optimized R scripts designed for **handling large datasets**, ensuring reproducibility and performance.  
- 🔍 **Facilitating Political & Economic Research** – Enables data-driven insights into **voting behavior, political trends, and historical shifts**.  
- 🎯 **Real-World Application** – Developed as part of a **university research project**, showcasing expertise in **data engineering, economic history, and political analysis**.  

This project highlights **strong data manipulation skills, problem-solving ability, and attention to detail**—essential qualities for **data analytics, and research roles**.  

## 📈 Output
